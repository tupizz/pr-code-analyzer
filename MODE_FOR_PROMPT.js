            `,

    brief: `
            Please give a brief explanation of the changes in a few sentences, be direct, less verbose. Use a simple language and add emojis to make it more fun. Don't need to add too much detail, just a brief explanation.
            
            IMPORTANT:
            - Don't use mardowns or code formatting. The output should be a simple text.
            - Make it easy to read. And don't be too verbose.
            - Don't be too much formal or too much casual. Be professional but friendly. The user is going to share this in a slack channel.
            - At the end of the output, add a section estimating the amount of time it will take to review the changes. 
            - Don't make the time estimation too long, it should be a rough estimate.
                Example:
                "⏱️ Estimated time to review: ~10 minutes"
            `,

    description: `
            Please describe the changes this PR is making in a few sentences and topics please.
            - Summarize the changes into few topics, but don't be too general. Explain the changes and the reasons for them.
            - When make sense create mermaid diagrams to explain the changes.
            - When make sense create sequence diagrams explaining the flow of the changes.
            - If there is any database changes, create a diagram to explain the changes, maybe a table schema diagram. Or ER diagram.
            - Make sure the generated mermaid diagrams are valid.
            - All texts inside the diagrams should be placed inside double quotes and escaped.
            - DON'T ADD COMMENTS TO THE DIAGRAMS. JUST THE DIAGRAM.
            - Don't add too many topics, make it easy to read. a Product person should be able to read this and understand the changes.
            - Don't be too verbose. Be very direct and to the point.
