Thank you for sharing your pull request (PR) changes! It looks like you've implemented several additions and updates across multiple files, which will help enhance the functionality of your application. Below, I'll highlight some bugs, potential issues, and suggestions for improvements. My feedback will aim to be constructive and supportive to help you improve the code quality.

### General Observations

1. **Code Consistency**: Ensure that the formatting and naming conventions remain consistent across all files, such as using consistent spacing around curly braces, proper indentation, and having uniform comment styles.

### Specific File Reviews

#### 1. `src/lib/CacheUtils.js`
- **Function Name**: `getDailyItemsByPublicIdsCacheKey`
  - The name is descriptive, however, consider changing it to `generateDailyItemsByPublicIdsCacheKey` to imply creation rather than retrieval.

#### 2. `src/lib/DateUtils.js`
- **Rounding Logic**: The function `getIntervalIdentifierRoundedToNearestMinutes` is generally well implemented. However, clarify in comments what the durationInMinutes argument represents. It's somewhat implied but specifying "e.g., for 30 minutes, it rounds to the nearest 30-minute mark" would help.
  
- **DateTime Dependency**: Ensure that the `DateTime` being referenced is indeed from the proper library (e.g., Luxon). If it's not properly imported, it will throw a reference error.

#### 3. `src/newRoutes/0.13/users/id/feeds/daily-items/get/GetUsersIdFeedsDailyItemsRoutes013.ts`
- **Dependency on External Middlewares**: The route registration uses a lot of external middleware. It might be beneficial to add some inline comments reminding future maintainers of the expected behaviors or purposes of those middlewares, especially `userAccessMiddleware`.

- **Error Handling**: While error handling in the `getHandler` method is present, ensure that the exact shape of error messages being logged considers exposure to end-users. You may want to limit the information logged to avoid leaking sensitive data.

#### 4. `src/newRoutes/0.13/users/id/feeds/daily-items/get/GetUsersIdFeedsDailyItemsSchema013.ts`
- **Validation Handling**: The `limit` query requires additional validation to ensure it does not exceed any limits you may want to set (e.g., maximum page size). Consider adding a `.max(100)` validation chain after the `.transform(...)`.

#### 5. `src/newRoutes/0.13/users/id/feeds/daily-items/get/GetUsersIdFeedsDailyItemsSerializer013.ts`
- **Code Comment Outdated Logic**: Review if the comment `// IMP: We do not show any buttons for the daily items in the dailies feed` is still relevant. It’s good practice to keep comments updated or remove superfluous comments.

#### 6. `src/repositories/DailyItemsRepository.js`
- **SQL Query Safety**: Ensure that the `publicIds` being passed to the SQL query are sanitized to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Although ORM libraries generally provide safeguards, double-checking is prudent.

- **Clause Completeness**: Verify the necessary joins are present and relevant to ensure all required data is fetched effectively. Failing to do so could lead to unexpected results.

#### 7. `src/services/dailies/DailyItemsCacheService.js`
- **Dependency Initialization**: The `DailyItemsCacheService` class grabs the cache TTL correctly, but ensure that it’s regularly reviewed to avoid stale data in caches beyond expected lifespan, especially for dynamic data such as daily items.

- **Comment Clarity**: The comment `// IMP: we use the DAILY_SHORT_CACHE_TTL = 60 secs TTL to cache this so that it's still random after a minute` can be enhanced by specifying why randomness is desired in this context, as it adds clarity around business logic decisions.

#### 8. `src/services/nextDailies/RecommendNextDailyService.ts`
- **Syntax Verification**: The removal of some lines here seems abrupt. Carefully ensure that the logic flow remains unbroken, especially around exits from loops or conditions that handle data appropriately.

### Conclusion

Overall, your PR looks well-structured, and you've clearly taken steps to enhance the readability and functionality of the code.
